## Creating JAR file with Maven

### Runnable JAR file
Separated solution from the whole Java Backend Junior course.

Created a simple Hello World class, and created a runnable 'jar' file with Maven. To run the app, open command line, browse the folder where the jar file is located and run it with the following command:

java -jar distjar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

I hope you can enjoy this course like me :)
